  # About
  disable_about: false
  descripe_l1_person: "Not your usual data science enthusiast. I am a total data fanatic; with so much data available, I love deriving valuable insights. I clean and analyse data for fun. I love mathematics as well. Since data science and machine learning use math extensively, I enjoy exploring and studying data even more! I also like working on artificial neural networks and natural language processing. I code primarily in Python."
  descripe_l2_person: "I have experience developing front-end websites, and I've designed websites for two student clubs in my college. I also have managerial experience; I was successful in helping build two student bodies in the past that are now fully functioning independently."
  descripe_l3_person: "I'm skilled in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Fron-end Web Development, and Data Structures and Algorithms. You can find my works [here](#projects)."
